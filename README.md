# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project contains information about red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The quality of the wine is rated on a scale from 0 to 10.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be found [here](link_to_dataset). It contains several physicochemical features such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, etc., along with the quality rating.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nandhini-1402/wine-quality-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to see the analysis and results.
3. Modify parameters or algorithms as needed for experimentation.

## Approach
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset, visualize distributions, correlations, etc.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features, etc.
3. Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
5. Fine-tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of selected models to improve performance.
6. Conclusion: Summarize findings and suggest further improvements.

## Results
- Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of X%.
- Support Vector Machine Classifier achieved an accuracy of Y%.
- Further details can be found in the notebook.
